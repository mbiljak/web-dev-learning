# Web Dev Learning 🚀

Welcome to my web development learning repository. 

This repo is a structured log of my journey from core web technologies to advanced full-stack development — enriched by my background in systems, algorithms, and AI.

## 🧠 Study Workflow

I'm using:
- **Obsidian** for conceptual understanding, linking ideas, and long-term retention
- **GitHub** for all hands-on exercises, iterative builds, and project tracking

### 🧩 Study Flow:
1. **Understand Concepts** → Notes in Obsidian
2. **Code Exercises** → Practice files in this repo
3. **Build Projects** → Apply knowledge to full builds
4. **Scale Up** → Add backend, AI, real-time features, and deploy

## 🎯 Goals

- Build scalable web applications from scratch
- Integrate AI models and real-time systems into web UIs
- Master full-stack development for engineering-grade tools
- Design systems with performance, modularity, and reliability in mind
- Develop a personal project portfolio reflecting both web and AI/engineering skills

## 🔁 Commit Philosophy

This repo follows a "learning in public" model:
- **Frequent commits** for every meaningful change or learning step
- **Descriptive messages** for future reflection
- **Clean branches** for major builds or experiments

## 👣 Long-Term Vision

As an engineering student with a focus on **AI systems**, I aim to:

- Build intelligent apps that bridge hardware, web, and ML models
- Use the web as a delivery layer for engineering visualizations, simulations, or real-time inference tools
